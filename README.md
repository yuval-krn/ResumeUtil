# Resume Util

A Python utility for quickly converting resume edits within a .docx file to a pdf format. The previously used pdf resume is copied over to ./OldResumes, where it's timestamped in case you need to revert to an older PDF version

### Usage

Make sure you have the ```docx2pdf``` package intalled. Setup instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/AlJohri/docx2pdf)

### Why was this built?

This automated process saves me time. Instead of needing to click around, manually converting, copying over, and moving files all of this is now handled by the Python script.
